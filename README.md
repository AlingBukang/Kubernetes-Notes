### Kubernetes Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and code snippets from learning [Kubernetes], an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes can be used to run applications across multiple clusters, environments, and platforms.

### Why Kubernetes?
I decided to learn Kubernetes because I wanted to:
- Deploy and manage complex applications with ease and efficiency
- Scale and update my applications dynamically based on demand and performance
- Utilize the benefits of containerization, such as portability, isolation, and consistency
- Apply the best practices of cloud-native development, such as microservices, DevOps, and CI/CD

### Whatâ€™s in this repository?
This repository contains the following files:

`notes`: This folder contains my notes on various topics related to Kubernetes, such as installation, architecture, components, objects, controllers, services, networking, storage, security, etc. The notes are written in Markdown format and organized by chapters.

### How to use this repository?
You can use this repository as a reference or a guide for your own learning journey with Kubernetes. You can also clone or fork this repository and modify it according to your needs. To run the code examples, you will need to have Kubernetes installed on your machine or access to a Kubernetes cluster. You can find more details on how to do that in the notes.

### Feedback and contributions
I welcome any feedback or contributions to this repository. You can contact me via email or open an issue or a pull request on GitHub. I hope you find this repository useful and enjoy learning Kubernetes as much as I did. ðŸ˜Š
